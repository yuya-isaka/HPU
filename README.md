# HPU　（Hyperdimensional Processing Unit)

Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is an efficient technique for performing various cognitive tasks by mapping data to hyperdimensional vectors consisting of thousands to tens of thousands of dimensions. However, the main operations of HDC - Bind, Permutation, and Bound - require several cycles in the computing unit, making it inefficient to perform HDC on a CPU platform. To address this, we propose the Hyperdimensional Processing Unit (HPU), a programmable accelerator specialized for HDC. By cooperating with the CPU, HDC can execute various tasks at high speed and with low power consumption. Our accelerator enables support for any HDC encoding method by allowing the selection of three operations per cycle. Evaluation experiments with the ARM-v7 processor show that HDC operations can be accelerated by a maximum of 169 times, and our accelerator can improve the energy-delay product up to 13,469 times in the training of handwritten character recognition task (MNIST).
